#Reviews
This is such a great course to start learning Django from scratch. Celeb give general ideas about models, views, templates, url patterns as well as how to implement and install an Django project and app. At the end, I have a beautiful site of Pet medicine and one admin page. The admin page you can view the databases of pets and adjust the control of users on site.
